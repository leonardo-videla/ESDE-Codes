# ESDE-Codes
Open access codes for simulation of phylogenetic trees based upon ESDE
The main code for the simulations associated to the paper "Evolving systems of stochastic differential equations" is kept on two files:

- ESDE_OU_PHYLO.m, for the case of independent rates of jump of the discrete chain.
- ESDE_OU_PHYLO2.m, for the diffusion-dependent rate of jumps.

The solver is contained in Multi_OU_Phylo.m.
